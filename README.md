## 🌍 Open Source Contributions
I’ve contributed to several public NOAA/EMC projects used by the atmospheric science and data community:  

- [**EMCPy**](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/emcpy) — Designed and optimized visualization system for flexible diagnostics, streamlining performance analysis across assimilation systems.
- [**PyGSI**](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/PyGSI) — Developed Python-based tool to filter, clean, and evaluate observational meteorological data, supporting data assimilation diagnostics for the NOAA Global Statistical Interpolation system.
- [**eva**](https://github.com/JCSDA-internal/eva) - Contributed to data I/O and visualization code. EMCPy is used for backend plotting.
- [**wdqms**](https://github.com/kevindougherty-noaa/wdqms) - Migrated legacy Fortran code to Python, reducing codebase by 50% and expanded functionality for global data quality monitoring.
